# MeltpoolNet

This github repository contains the datasets and codes for our paper "MeltpoolNet: Melt pool Characteristic Prediction in Metal Additive Manufacturing Using Machine Learning" published in the jounal of Additive Manufacturing. 
# Dataset
Two dataset has been collected for the MeltpoolNet:
1. [Regression dataset for the meltpool geometry](https://github.com/BaratiLab/MeltpoolNet/blob/main/Data/meltpoolnet_regression.csv)
2. [Classification dataset for the meltpool modes and defects](https://github.com/BaratiLab/MeltpoolNet/blob/main/Data/meltpoolnet_classification.csv) 

# Prerequisites
The following modules and packages are required in order to run the associated code:
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* XGBoost
* matplotlib
* scipy
* hyperopt

They can be installed independently, or all at once by running `pip install -r [requirements.txt](https://github.com/BaratiLab/MeltpoolNet/blob/main/requirements.txt)`
